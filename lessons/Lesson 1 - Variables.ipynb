    "\n",
    "Unlike many programming langauges, variable types are `inferred` or `implicit` in Python - what this means is that you don't have to say that your variable is an `int` or a `str` - your computer will guess what type your variable is.\n",

    " * `>`, `>=`, `<` and `<=` : In order from left to right, these are \"greater than\", \"greater than or equal to\", \"less than\", \"less than or equal to\". Similar to the equality operators, they will return a `bool` depending on if the operand on the right is greater/less/equal to the operand on the right. These work how you would expect for `int` and `float` types, but for `str`s, they actually compare *lexocagraphical order* as in `\"a\" < \"b\"` resolves to `True` because `\"a\"` comes before `\"b\"` and likewise, `\"banana\" > \"bandana\"` would resolve to `False`. While this *generally* means alphabetical/dictionary order, it's not always the case! For example, all CAPITAL are before all lowercase letters. If you want specifics, this is due to Python comparing each character's [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) ordering. For this reason, if you're ever comparing strings like this, you want to use a method like [`str.lower()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.lower) in order to alleviate this."

    " - Expressions are piecess of code that evaluate to a literal value.\n",
    "   - Literals are typed! The four basic (primitive) types are: `int`, `float`, `bool`, and `str`.\n",
    " - Variables are a way of \"naming\" or aliasing specific expressions and can be used as operands, passed into functions, and defining other variables.\n",
    "   - Variable names should be descriptive and must not break any of the naming restrictions!\n",
    " - Operands are ways of manipulating variables and can form expressions with operands.\n",
    " - You can use type casting to convert from one type to another.\n",
    " - Comments are a way of adding explanations or context for readers or temporarily disabling lines of code.\n",
    " - The `print()` function will covert its argument to a string and output it to an output stream (usually your screen!)\n",
    " - The `round()` function takes in a number and round sit to the nearest integer.\n",
    " - The `input()` function takes in a prompt to display and returns a user's response in the form of a `str`.\n"
