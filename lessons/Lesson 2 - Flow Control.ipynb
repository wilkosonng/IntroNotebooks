    "# Boolean Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall in [Lesson 1](./Lesson%201%20-%20Variables.ipynb) that we discussed some basic operators such as addition, multiplication, and even concatenation or modulo. If you're any familiar with the origin of the Boolean type in [Boolean Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra), you may already be familiar with these operators: `AND` (conjunction), `OR` (disjunction), and `NOT` (negation).     \n",
    "\n",
    "While these operators can be used on most data types, we'll strictly focus on how they interact with the raw `bool` type. As a reminder, `bool`s are simply the set of the 2 values `True` and `False`. To explore these operators, we can tabulate a `Truth Table`. In essence, these tables list all combinations of inputs for the operator and show the operational output. For binary boolean operators, this means `2 * 2 = 4` rows. If it's a bit hard to visualize at the moment, it'll make a lot more sense once you actually see one! Without further ado, let's take a look!\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `and` operator\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, the boolean operators are pretty intuitively-named. The `and` operator takes in two operands, and outputs `True` if and only if *both operands* are `True`; otherwise, it will output `False`. You can think of this operator requiring both the first ***and*** the second operand to evaluate to `True` in order to also output `True`.    \n",
    "\n",

    "While a bit unintuitive, this is a fairly common pattern in many programming languages. In fact, some languages such as `C` don't have a dedicated type for boolean values. Instead, they rely on the truthiness of a value. One thing you may have noticed is that when combined with the newly-acquired boolean operators, the expressions resolve to the original values rather than booleans. This is intentional! Going from left to right, the `or` operator outputs either the first truthy value if it resolves to `True` or the last falsy value if it resolves to `False`. The `and` operator, on the other hand, either outputs the last truthy value if it resolves to `True` or the first falsy value that causes it to resolve to `False`. You can think of the shorthand being the output of the operator is the first value that *causes* the resolution to either `True` or `False`. Although it will take some time to get used to, once you manage to grasp it, it can lead to some interesting quirks and shortcuts once we delve into flow control.

Perhaps a real life example would be a a To-Do list which would produce the strings `\"Breakfast\"`, `\"School\"`, `\"Lunch\"`, `\"Homework\"`, `\"Dinner\"` in that order. A `for` loop would then execute its code block for each item in the iterable, so for the example given, it'd execute a total of 5 times.

You know from the beginning that no matter what, you'll have to look through the entire string, so the simplest way to do this is to just iterate through the entire string.\n",

    " - While loops are the opposite: where you don't know ahead of time how much you want to loop. Thus, you make best use of the conditional nature of the loop. Suppose you want to check the number of digits. One way we can do this is to repeatedly divide by 10, decreasing the digit each time until the number equals 0. A for loop wouldn't do us much good here since we'd have to know the answer ahead of time!

    "This is your first more open-ended programming challenge and I hope you enjoy! Once again, it may help to break the core functionality down into several parts:  \n",
    " - What variables should you declare?\n",
    " - What tools and Python language constructs should you use (i.e. *how* are you going to achieve the program behavior?)\n",
    " - What conditions or iterators are you going to use for your `if` statements, `while` loops, and `for` loops?\n",
    " - What general behavior should be in and out of the code blocks for your statements?\n",
    " - Are there any other edge cases you need to handle for this program?\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a lot to consider, but don't fret! Try to answer each question one at a time. Also note that there are so many ways that you can handle each question! Try to think of all the tools you've learned so far and pick one that you think would best suit the purpose. If you're stuck, I suggest iterating on a solution in the following order:       \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Print the numbers 1 up to `num_turns` in order.\n",
    "2. Add in functionality to print in Fizz and Buzz where they should be.\n",
    "   - You can start out by printing it out alongside the number. Then, work to *replace* the number with the Fizz and Buzz.\n",
    "3. Add in functionality to print in FizzBuzz where it should be.\n",
    "4. Add in functionality to print Alice and Bob's names.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, I wish you the best of luck!"

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    " - Booleans and non-boolean values can be operated on via the operators `and`, `or`, and `not`.\n",
    "   - For non-boolean values, they rely on their `truthiness` property.\n",
    " - Flow control allows us to conditionally execute code as well as repeatedly execute lines of code.\n",
    " - The `if` statement conditionally executes a following code block if its conditional expression resolves to `True`.\n",
    "   - You can further branch off `if` statements with `else` and `elif` statements.\n",
    "   - The order of additional conditions matter as code is executed sequentially in a top-down fashion!\n",
    " - The `while` loop continues executing the following code block as long as its condition resolves to `True`\n",
    "   - It's paramount to be able to update the condition either externally or within the code block to not result in an `infinite` loop!\n",
    " - The `for` loop continues executing the following code block for each item in its `iterator`.\n",
    "   - Iterators are an object that output items in a set order.\n",
    "   - The `range()` function results in an iterator of `int`s based on a start, stop, and step we provide. The defaults values for which are 0, N/A, and 1 respectively.\n",
    "   - `str`s are also iterators!\n",
    " - You can exit out of any loop with a `break` statement!\n",
    " - You can skip an iteration of a loop with a `continue` statement!\n",
    " - Nesting loops are for when you need to repeat something each iteration!\n",
    " - Try to use `for` loops if you need the indexing or know ahead of time the number of iterations. Use `while` loops for when it's difficult to know how many loops you need ahead of time!"
