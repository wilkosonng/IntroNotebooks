# Notes Notebooks

These are provided notes nootbooks that you may use if you so desire. They encompass what I think are the most important takeaways of each lesson.      
They're provided as-is with fill-in-the-blank type items you can expand upon. Even if you don't plan to use them directly, they should be a helpful resource to make sure you're understanding all of the lessons in full.
