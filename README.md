# Setting Up

This is a repository of notebooks I've created for private lessons, though they're free for anyone to use!
To start, download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have those set up, go into VS Code and download the Jupyter Notebook and Python extensions:
 1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + X`. 
 2. Just search up `Python` and `Jupyter`. Alternatively, navigate to [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) for Python and [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) for Jupyter.
 3. Open some of the lesson files into VS Code as Interactive Python Notebooks (.ipynb file extension). To get these on your device, either use `git` (if you're unfamiliar, learn about git [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ultimate-guide-git-github/)) and clone this repo or directly download the notebooks. 
 
 Note that these lessons mostly follow the 2nd Edition of *Automate the Boring Stuff* by Al Sweigart, which is [available to read for free](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) if you wish to use it as an additional resource or prefer that method of learning!
